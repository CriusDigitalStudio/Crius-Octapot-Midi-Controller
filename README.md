# Crius-Octapot-Midi-Controller
This is a simple midi controller that consists of 8 Linear Rotary Potentiometers 
that sends Control Change messages to your DAW in order to control the parameters you map it to. 
Its powered by an Arduino Nano that uses serial communication 
so you need to install Loopmidi and Hairless in order to translate Serial data to MIDI data and use it properly.
